Transactional CarMart: Basic infinispan example with transactions
=================================================================

Summary: Show how to use Infinispan instead of a relational database with transactions enabled.

What is it?
-----------

Transactional CarMart is a simple web application that uses Infinispan instead of a relational database.
Users can list cars, add new cars or remove them from the CarMart. Information about each car
is stored in a cache. The application also shows cache statistics like stores, hits, retrievals, etc.

The Transactional CarMart quickstart works in a library mode. All libraries (jar files) are bundled 
with the application and deployed into the server. Caches are configured programatically and run 
in the same JVM as the web application.

All operations are done in a transactional context. In order to run the application in Tomcat, 
a standalone transaction manager from JBoss Transactions is used.



System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven 3.0 or better.

The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 or JBoss AS 7. 

 
Configure Maven
---------------

Contributor: You can copy or link to the Maven configuration information in the README file in the root folder of the quickstarts. For example:

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.md#configure-maven-) before testing the quickstarts.


Building and deploying to Tomcat 7
----------------------------------

1) This build assumes you will be running Tomcat 7 in its default
   configuration, with a hostname of localhost and port 8080. Before starting
   Tomcat, add the following lines to `conf/tomcat-users.xml` to allow the Maven
   Tomcat plugin to access the manager application:

    <role rolename="manager-script"/>
    <user username="admin" password="SOMEPASSWD" roles="manager-script"/>
    
2) Start Tomcat 7

    `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh run`

3) Build the application

    `mvn clean package -Plibrary-tomcat`

4) Add a `<server>` element into your Maven settings.xml with `<id>` equal to `tomcat` and correct credentials:

    `<server>
         <id>tomcat</id>
         <username>admin</username>
         <password>SOMEPASSWD</password>
     </server>`

5) Deploy the application via tomcat Maven plugin

    `mvn tomcat:deploy -Plibrary-tomcat`

6) Go to http://localhost:8080/carmart-quickstart-tx

7) Undeploy the application

    `mvn tomcat:undeploy -Plibrary-tomcat`
